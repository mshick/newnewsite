DEMO MATERIAL! NOT MINE!

Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by
Edward Tufte's books and handouts. Tufte's style is known for its simplicity,
extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and
carefully chosen typography.

Tufte CSS was created by [Dave Liepmann][dl] and is now an Edward Tufte project.
The original idea was cribbed from
[Tufte LaTeX][tufte-latex] and [R Markdown's Tufte Handout
format][r-markdown]. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have
contributed to those projects.

If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution
in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: [tufte-css].
Please note the [contribution guidelines][contrib].

Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print.
Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say "websites
should look like this interpretation of Tufte's books" but rather "here are some
techniques Tufte developed that we've found useful in print; maybe you can find
a way to make them useful on the web". Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way
to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a
design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits
their particular circumstances.

## Getting Started

To use Tufte CSS, copy `tufte.css` and the `et-book` directory of font files to
your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document's `head`
block:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css" />
```

Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions
described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element
frequently.

## Fundamentals

### Sections and Headings

Organize your document with an `article` element inside your `body` tag. Inside
that, use `section` tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.

Tufte CSS uses `h1` for the document title, `p` with class `subtitle` for the
document subtitle, `h2` for section headings, and `h3` for low-level headings.
More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a
heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:

> [It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of
> physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters
> and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of _sentences_ which then cumulate sequentially into _paragraphs_, rather than
> the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated
> material, but it didn't require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.
>
> [@quote-cite]

As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of
block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct
HTML using `blockquote` and `footer` elements. See page 20 of [The Visual
Display of Quantitative Information][vdqi] for an example in print.

In his later books[^1], Tufte starts each
section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first
few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the
class `newthought`, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical
spacing is accomplished separately through tags. Be consistent: though we do so
in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of
header elements and the `newthought` technique. Pick one approach and stick to
it.

### Text

Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is
better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS
uses `#fffff8` and `#111111` because they are nearly indistinguishable from
their 'pure' cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the
greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and
images.

In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo[^2] font. A similar
effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source
[ETBook][et-book], which Tufte CSS supplies with a `@font-face` reference to a
.ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn't work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to
other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.

Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and
italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform
the text. This is typographic best practice.


    If you prefer sans-serifs, use the `sans` class. It relies on Gill Sans,
    Tufte's sans-serif font of choice.


Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover
or when clicked. Here is a [dummy example](#) that goes nowhere. These links are
underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable
text. [^blue] However, because most browsers' default underlining does not clear
descenders and is so thick and distracting, the underline effect is instead
achieved using CSS trickery involving background gradients instead of standard
`text-decoration`. Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for that technique.

[^blue]:
    [-] Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is
    crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use
    of underlining.

As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides
by default. Other approaches, such as changing color on click or mouseover, or
using highlighting or color instead of underlining to denote links, could also
be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference
from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web
users.
